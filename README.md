# Welcome 

This repository contains (part of) the outcome of creating a [Simplygon](simplygon.com/) cloud service using Azure Functions. In particular, this Function takes a zip file, extracts it, and runs Smplygon's polygon reduction alghorithms. After that, you'll get a zip file back with the results. We have tested this with Simplygon 9 (the paid version as of this writing). 

Find out more about the background and other work surrounding this project [here](http://peted.azurewebsites.net/simplygon-in-azure/).

Click the deploy to Azure button below to get up and running quickly. 

# Quick start

We'll ask for a valid Simplygon license key and a Simplygon SDK version in order to automatically set you up with those (i.e. download the SDK and install the license key file). 

## Slow start 

The C# code in this repository links to the Simplygon SDK which we can't include here (the same for their license). The above [deployment script](deploy.cmd) does the downloading and configuration of the SDK and licenses automatically, which are the following steps:

1. Download the latest SDK [zip file from Simplygon](https://www.simplygon.com/Downloads)
1. Extract it somewhere on the Azure Function's file system
1. Place your license key (`.dat` file) in the SDK's directory
1. Set up an environment variable (configuration variable) `SIMPLYGON_9_PATH` to point to the SDK location

The actual deployment can be done in several ways:

- Create a private git repository with all files (this code, SDK, license) included and use CI/CD to deploy it to Functions 
- Build everything locally and FTP it into the Function environment
- Use the [Functions CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools) to publish everything and 
- Whatever is mentioned in our [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment)

When creating the Functions resource in Azure, please read the next section below to get the right size and configuration.

## Knowing your Azure resources

This Function does some fairly heavy work and requires appropriate hardware to finish in time. Azure Functions have a maximum runtime of 5 minutes, which is _not enough_ to remesh even a simple model using the regular consumption plan. For our experiments we used a EP2 plan (420 ACU, 7 GB memory) and managed to remesh the same model in about 45 seconds, but anything with a faster CPU will do it even quicker. Keeping that in mind, here are some more details of the Function:

- Azure Functions v2 with dotnet core runtime on Windows
- Switch the Functions runtime to **64 bits**, or Simplygon assembly won't be loaded
- EP1 plan or better (e.g. Premium App Service plans)

When the deployment is finished, you can run some code to fetch the results.

# Interacting with your new polygon reduction API

The Function exposes a `GET`/`POST` API with two parameters: `InputZipUri` and `OnScreenSize` (optional, defaults to 300). For a `POST` request, send a `JSON` object in the body; `GET` requests can use those parameters in the URL. 

- `InputZipUri` refers to a zip file (accessible for the Function of course) that contains valid polygon and material files in its root. Typically this would be a URL from something like an Azure Storage Account (as in the example below).
- `OnScreenSize` is the object's size in pixels and an input parameter for the remeshing. While the default is 300, a number larger than 20 is required with the actual value depending on your use case.

Here is an example call of the API using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html). The `InputZipUri` is a SAS token URI for an Azure Storage Account with public access and the returned content is a zip file to be stored (in this case) at `/tmp/out.zip`:  

```sh
$ curl -d '{"InputZipUri": "https://[BLOB ACCOUNT NAME].blob.core.windows.net/obj/[ZIPPED BLOB NAME WITH SAS TOKEN]" , "OnScreenSize": 300 }' https://[AZURE FUNCTION NAME].azurewebsites.net/api/Remesh -o /tmp/out.zip

# Contributing 

While this is a prototypical implementation, we welcome help in keeping this up to date and working. Feel free to add issues for what isn't working or send a PR to add specifc features that we didn't include. If you are looking for ideas, here is a list of things that we know are missing:

- Proper error status codes. Right now everything is a 500 if something goes wrong
- Improved robustness
- Testing with Simplygon 8 (free)
